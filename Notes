NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegation Index, it's widely used remote sensing index that help measure the health and desnity of vegtation using statellite imagery.

NDVI = (NIR - RED)/(NIR + RED)

* NIR: Near infrared Light(vegation strongly reflect this)
* RED: Red light (vegatation absorbs this for photosynthesis)

Why NDVI is Useful
- Healthy vegetation reflects more NIR and absorbs more red light.
- NDVI captures this contrast to estimate vegetation health and coverage.
- Unhealthy or sparse vegetation reflects less NIR.



EVI: EVI stands for Enhanced Vegetation Index — a vegetation index like NDVI, but designed to be more sensitive to dense vegetation and to reduce the influence of atmospheric effects and soil background. 

- formula uses blue light as well to remove atmoshere refelectance
- Two areas may have equal NDVI:
    - One with sparse vegetation and light-colored soil
    - Another with slightly denser vegetation and darker soil
    NDVI can’t distinguish well between them



Start with NDVI:
- Easier to understand and compare with past research.
- Works well in most conditions with healthy vegetation.

Also compute EVI:
- Compare trends with NDVI across time and crop stages.
- In most studies, EVI gives more stable and **stronger correlations with yield**, especially in areas with complex terrain, soil brightness, or high canopy density.




Investigation:

- Tracking NDVI peak values over time for the Kharif and Rabi seasons is one of the most practical and widely used methods to assess and compare:
 - at the time of growth compare the nvdi peak - if peak is different then there is problem
 - process the , mark kharif month sowing, kharif harvesting

 Timing	Was there delay in NDVI rise?


 Use NDVI in June (early monsoon / early Kharif) as baseline, and compare it to the NDVI peak later (e.g., Sep–Oct), then compare that delta to past 5–10 years.


water source: Rainfall / Precipitation
Soil Moisture: even if rainfall, relatively soil is moisture enough than it's a problem, how steady was the moisture

Temperature influences:
    Germination: Too cold or too hot can delay/stop sprouting.

    Growth Rate: Plants grow faster under optimal temps.

    Flowering: Sensitive to heat. High temps → flower drop → yield loss.

    Evapotranspiration: High temp = higher water demand
